# Why GEXT?

As a developer, I frequently clone and fork repositories. I often have two copies of the same repository (original and forked) and end up cloning both. `gext` is a command-line tool that helps manage local clones of various repositories. 
Cloning with `gext` organizes the repositories into a tree structure, where the GITHUB folder contains owners/organizations, which in turn contain folders for individual repositories. 
In short, `gext` helps organize local copies of repositories, forked or otherwise.
